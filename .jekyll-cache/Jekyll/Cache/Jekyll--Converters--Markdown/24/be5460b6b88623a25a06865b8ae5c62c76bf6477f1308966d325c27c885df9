I"ò<p>After 4 months in Palo Alto for work I have compiled some of my favorite photos from my stay there. Most weekends my roommates and I would check out some of the features of the area and each week I would use one of the images from that trip as my phone wallpaper.</p>

<h1 id="the-trip">The Trip</h1>

<p>Iâ€™ve put these ones up at <a href="https://unsplash.com/@danreynolds">Unsplash</a> and plan to add a few more once I sort through them all. Take a look and use them if you would like, Iâ€™ve got ones ranging from the Muir Woods to the Santa Cruz Pier, Yosemite Park, and Big Sur.</p>

<p>The entire trip was a blast and itâ€™s hard not to become a bit of a photographer when thereâ€™s so many awesome sites to see and capture.</p>
