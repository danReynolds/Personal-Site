<h2 id="writing-good-code">Writing Good Code</h2>

<p>While the details of writing good code are highly subjective, a good basic rule is to try and optimize your implementations for <em>correctness</em> and <em>clarity</em>.</p>

<p>The code needs to accomplish the task for which it was written, and it needs to be done in a way that is straightforward, so that it can be effectively refactored, shared and extended.</p>

<p>We spend a fair amount of our lives as developers trying to prove to ourselves that our code respects these two tenants.</p>

<p>We write tests and run linters to provide confidence in our code‚Äôs correctness and sprinkle comments and documentation in our implementations to help others (and often our forgetful selves) understand the more complicated or hacky pieces that make up our applications.</p>

<p>It has been said in the programming community that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shared mutable state is the root of all evil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that‚Äôs the case, then the application state we write, refactor, and share with other programmers every day makes myself and most other developers very evil people.</p>

<p>But of course that‚Äôs not the case, and in fact, there are many things we can do to make the shared mutable states of our applications clearer and more correct. Let‚Äôs start with a simple example:</p>

<h3 id="how-many-states-does-this-code-have">How many states does this code have?</h3>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">enabled</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You: 2!
<br />
Me: You‚Äôre right!</p>

<h3 id="how-about-this-code">How about this code?</h3>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">enabled</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="nx">eligible</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">eligible</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You: 4?
<br />
Me: Right again!</p>

<p>But how many of those states are we explicitly handling? Only 2. What happens in those other 2 cases? Usually nothing, but potentially errors that we haven‚Äôt accounted for, or that we‚Äôll uncover when we add new functionality.</p>

<p>This is an example of how from the basic conditionals we first learn to the complex systems we spend hours reviewing and testing, we are programmed to program for happy paths.</p>

<h2 id="transitioning-to-state-machines">Transitioning to state machines</h2>

<p>Without a structured approach to iterating the states our code can be in it can be very difficult to make sure that you have all of your bases covered. I‚Äôd argue that most, if not all developers have stumbled upon routines consisting of questionably named flag variables used in convoluted combinations whose author is either long gone or too promoted to ask anymore.</p>

<p>So what techniques can we use to help us structure clear and correct application state? One approach our team has tried in the past is to use <strong>state machines</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tech/state-machine.png" alt="state-machine" /></p>

<p>The concept of a state machine is fairly simple. While combinations of conditionals create inexhaustive, implicit applications states, state machines require explicit and comprehensive
definitions of all the application states and valid transitions between them in a system.</p>

<p>Our team‚Äôs first state machine used the <a href="https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-state-machine">javascript state machine</a> (JSM) library to define our application‚Äôs authentication process. For a React-Native application like ours, that involved managing a lot of different application states ranging from account registration and sign-in, to biometrics, deep-linking, backgrounding, and offline support, not to mention the nuances of the respective iOS and Android platforms.</p>

<p>Our previous authentication flow had consisted of a lot of nested conditionals and long function bodies and comparatively our state machine approach had some immediate advantages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The diagrams of our authentication state machine generated by the library helped us better document and reason about our implementation.</li>
  <li>Dividing the process into a series of states and transitions led to clearer, more organized code.</li>
  <li>State machines have their own data store, allowing us to encapsulate authentication details within our state machine instead of our global Redux store.</li>
</ol>

<p>Our state machine configurations looked something like this:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">auth</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">StateMachine</span><span class="p">({</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The JSM configuration consumes a set of states and transitions, as well as lifecycle handlers for entering, leaving and transitioning between states. Each step in our authentication system received its own state and the business logic we need to perform was executed in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onEnterState</code> lifecycle handlers.</p>

<p>While it was definitely an improvement from our previous implementation, over time as we modified and added new steps to the authentication process it once again became difficult to work with and we had to overcome a new set of problems inherent to state machines:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>State explosion</strong>: Whenever we add a new dimension to the system, we get exponentially more states.
Managing the state of a user being authenticated vs unauthenticated becomes four potential states when we add the notions of backgrounded vs foregrounded:</li>
</ul>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Authenticated/Foregrounded</td>
      <td>Unauthenticated/Backgrounded</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Authenticated/Backgrounded</td>
      <td>Unauthenticated/Backgrounded</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Poor separation of concerns</strong>: All of the authentication logic is in a single big state machine. The biometrics logic is co-located with the logic for the sign-in and deep-linking states and overall the authentication state machine had too many responsibilities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Big graphs and lines everywhere</strong>: Our purpose for using state machines was to make it easier to reason about and organize complex systems. Looking at a diagram with 10 states and a spider web of transitions doesn‚Äôt help much to lower that cognitive burden.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="enter-statecharts">Enter statecharts</h2>

<p>statecharts are a layer on top of state machines that enhance the core concept of a graph-based definition of system states with additional features and patterns for managing complexity.</p>

<p>While the JavaScript community is known for being quick to embrace new and unproven technologies, a formalization for the statecharts model was introduced decades ago in this <a href="http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/seoc/2005_2006/resources/statecharts.pdf">public paper</a> and the system has already applied in a number of real-world scenarios:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When NASA used the Statechart Autocoder to build the software for the Mars Science Laboratory (the Curiosity Rover), one of the reported benefits of using Statecharts was that ‚Äúit forced developers to consider off nominal scenarios‚Äù.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whether you call them bugs, features, or off nominal scenarios, statecharts can help developers identify edge cases and write clearer state machine implementations.</p>

<p>Before we implement a statechart, we‚Äôll need to become familiar with some of its core terminology:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>states</strong>: Either atomic nodes corresponding to a single state or compound nodes consisting of substates.</li>
  <li><strong>events</strong>: The triggers for transitions from one state to another.</li>
  <li><strong>actions</strong>: Synchronous side-effects performed on transitioning, entering or exiting a state.</li>
  <li><strong>activities</strong>: Asynchronous side-effects similar to actions, but which take a period of time to complete.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="hierarchical-states">Hierarchical states</h3>

<p>statecharts address the problem of poor-encapsulation by supporting hierarchies of states.</p>

<p>A compound state like a user‚Äôs activity in a form can be broken down into a number of substates like name, birthdate, address and others.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tech/xstate-nested.png" alt="state-machine-nested" /></p>

<h3 id="parallel-states">Parallel states</h3>

<p>To address the state explosion issue, statecharts support parallel states. A parallel state node is in all of its child states at the same time.</p>

<p>A system of boolean conditions like <em>authenticated/unauthenticated</em> and <em>foregrounded/backgrounded</em> will now grow linearly as opposed to exponentially and can better represent the state of the system, since a user can be both authenticated and backgrounded simultaneously.</p>

<h3 id="chart-visualizations">Chart visualizations</h3>

<p>One of the biggest advantages of the statechart model is its translation into a clear and formalized visual statechart diagram:</p>

<p><img src="/images/tech/xstate-example.png" alt="state-machine-example" /></p>

<p>The diagrams follows the W3C statechart XML (SCXML) implementation and can clearly illustrate every part of a state machine configuration including parallel and hierarchical states.</p>

<h2 id="statecharts-in-action-xstate">statecharts in action: xstate</h2>

<p>xstate is a JavaScript implementation of the statechart model. It describes itself as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A library for creating, interpreting, and executing finite state machines and statecharts, as well as managing invocations of those machines as <strong>actors</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>xstate implements the statechart model with all of its core feature specifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Guarded transitions</li>
  <li>Actions (entry, exit, transition)</li>
  <li>Activities</li>
  <li>Extended state (context)</li>
  <li>Orthogonal (parallel) states</li>
  <li>Hierarchical (nested) states</li>
  <li>State history</li>
</ul>

<p>It additionally models each of its state machine objects as actors. The actor model is a model of concurrent computation that treats ‚Äúactors‚Äù as the universal primitives of a system, with each actor able to perform three core functions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Receive messages from other actors</li>
  <li>Send messages to other actors</li>
  <li>Do something with the messages it received (its behavior), such as:
    <ul>
      <li>change its local state</li>
      <li>send messages to other actors</li>
      <li>spawn new actors</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Each actor encapsulates its own logic and exchanges information with other state machines through events. In this way, an active state machine can be thought of similarly to a process running on your system, unable to access data from other services directly but able to share input and output between them.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs see how xstate can be used to model one of our actual button components. Our example code will be using React, but because its implementation is self-contained, it can be reused in your frontend framework of choice.</p>

<div class="language-jsx highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">Button</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">({</span>
  <span class="nx">onPress</span><span class="p">,</span>

      <span class="na">disabled=</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="nx">enabled</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="nx">onPress</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="nx">isLoading</span><span class="si">}</span>
    <span class="p">&gt;</span>
      <span class="si">{</span>
        <span class="nx">isLoading</span> <span class="p">?</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">Loading...</span><span class="dl">'</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">Submit</span><span class="dl">'</span>
      <span class="si">}</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">div</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
  <span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The button component has 3 inputs:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>onPress</strong>: Controls what happens when it‚Äôs clicked.</li>
  <li><strong>enabled</strong>: Manually override the enabled/disabled state of the button.</li>
  <li><strong>isLoading</strong>: Choose whether the button should display a loading state.</li>
</ol>

<p>It consumes these inputs to determine which one of the three mutually exclusive UI states to display: <strong>loading</strong>, <strong>enabled</strong> or <strong>disabled</strong>.</p>

<p>We write conditional logic like this all the time to model implicit state machines. While this approach generally works well as complexity remains low, even in a relatively simple button component we can identify some edge cases:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The button can become loading at the same time it is disabled.</li>
  <li>The button can become disabled at the same time it is loading.</li>
  <li>The style of the button can be changed at any time, even if loading or unhandled.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now let‚Äôs compare this to an explicit state machine model using xstate. We‚Äôll start with the state machine definition:</p>

<p>This configuration sets up an atomic enabled state and a compound disabled state. On receiving an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UPDATE</code> event, the state machine goes through
the transitions array until it finds the first transition that satisfies its condition and executes that transition.</p>

<p>The transition API is a pure function which takes an initial state and an event and returns the new state of the system. While a state machine with a pure <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.transition()</code> function is useful for flexibility, purity, and testability, in order for it to have any use in a real-life application, something needs to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep track of the current state, and persist it</li>
  <li>Execute side-effects</li>
  <li>Handle delayed transitions and events</li>
  <li>Communicate with external services</li>
</ul>

<p>An <strong>interpreter</strong> is responsible for interpreting the state machine/statechart and doing all of the above - that is, parsing and executing it in a runtime environment. An interpreted, running instance of a statechart is called a <strong>service</strong>.</p>

<p>Now that our conditional logic has been abstracted, we can focus on writing the plain presentational layer:</p>

<p>When we receive new props in our component, we send them to the running state machine service as an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UPDATE</code> event.</p>

<p>This explicit state machine has three main benefits over our first implementation:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The button can now only be in one state at a time (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">enabled</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">disabled.loading</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">disabled.manual</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">disabled.unhandled</code>)</li>
  <li>There is a priority to its states: If it is in the loading state and it receives a new manual <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">enabled=false</code> prop change,
it will not transition from the loading state.</li>
  <li>The state machine can be visualized according to the statechart specification.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is a diagram of our button state machine:</p>

<p><img src="/images/tech/xstate-button.png" alt="xstate button" /></p>

<p>The ability to visualize the states of a UI component or experience can benefit the entire team.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Engineers can refer to self-documented implementations while working with each other‚Äôs code.</li>
  <li>Design and QA can look at the diagrams to assert their expectations of the system and uncover any unexpected scenarios.</li>
  <li>Product managers can even use them to follow user journeys and ensure that product requirements have been met.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="modeling-flows">Modeling Flows</h2>

<p>statecharts are also useful tools for managing complex flows. For our development focusing on financial products, an example of such a flow could be an application for a new bank account.</p>

<p>This financial product will consist of a number of screens the user goes through to enter their personal information required for the application:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
  <li>SSN</li>
  <li>address</li>
</ul>

<p>Our above state machine generates the following visualization:</p>

<p><img src="/images/tech/application-machine.png" alt="xstate application machine" /></p>

<p>There a couple of new features to unpack here:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Context API</strong>: The statechart maintains its own data store called its <em>context</em> which can be assigned to using the <em>assign</em> action from the library.</li>
  <li><strong>Action handlers</strong>: Actions, as mentioned earlier, are synchronous side-effects that can be performed on transitioning, entering or exiting a state. Each time one of our UI states is entered, we perform a submit action to store the user‚Äôs information and push on a new screen.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="nested-flows">Nested Flows</h2>

<p>What if we wanted to allow a user to stop and resume applications for multiple financial products at a time?</p>

<p>As actors, each statechart service can spawn and manage its own child services. We can create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BankApplicationManagerMachine</code> to handle multiple applications:</p>

<p>Storing spawned applications and their data in a state machine separately from the UI has a number of advantages over a traditional data-in-components implementation:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Applications can process data in the background even when their components are unmounted</li>
  <li>Application services and their data is stored by the application manager and can be persisted and restored without any external data mechanism.</li>
  <li>The UI framework layer (e.g., React) becomes a plain view layer; logic and side-effects are not tied directly to the UI, except where it is appropriate.</li>
  <li>Business logic is testable independent of UI</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="a-new-state-of-mind">A New State of Mind</h2>

<p>Whether you have written state machines before, there are always state machines in our code, either implicit or explicit.</p>

<p>Implicit ones are generally harder to maintain, visualize and get right. In theory, an explicit state machine can help developers optimize for correctness and clarity in their code. In practice, it is important to point out the potential downsides to relying on state machine implementations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It‚Äôs a new set of tools and terminology: When to use a parallel state? What is an interpreter and a service?</li>
  <li>It increases the lines of code for smaller implementations especially</li>
  <li>It‚Äôs a different programming model, everyone is used to standard if/else conditional statements and there can be a lot of <em>a boolean is much simpler!</em> arguments between developers.</li>
</ul>

<p>The investigation and examples we‚Äôve looked at here make the case that the benefits of using state machines outweigh these concerns and ultimately present a compelling case for managing the shared, mutable states of our applications through explict state machines.</p>

<h3 id="investigating-further">Investigating Further</h3>

<p>There are excellent resources on both statecharts and xstate that I would recommend exploring if you‚Äôre interested in the topic:</p>

<!-- ## Demonstrate customizability with `withConfig`

## How it compares

* Extend using `withConfig` vs `extendFSM`
* Data store using context and assign
* Embed using compound states
* Side effects using actions
* final states = inactive states
* Guards for transitions vs guards for states
* Both have wildcard descriptor
* Exit state, transition, enter state actions are equivalent to the javascript-state-machine lifecycle events

## Side-by-Side Example

Pros:
* Hierarchical events allow for easy triggering of nested transitions, or actions that happen for any substate for example, can use forbidden transitions to prevent
parent triggering for change to certain nested states.
* Parallel states, something we haven't needed in navigation FSMs, maybe auth-fsm could benefit? Certainly helps components that can have their logic modeled this way, a component could be both *eligible* and *disabled* or some combo of that nature

Cons:
* No active FSM notion, we'd need to set that up, shouldn't be too hard
* No direct fast-forward equivalent, could use a transient transition for part of it
* No direct rewind equivalent -->
